# GP Predictor

## Domain Background

* [ ] Student briefly details background information of the domain from which the project is proposed.
* [ ] Historical information relevant to the project should be included.
* [ ] It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved.
* [ ] Related academic research should be appropriately cited.
* [ ] A discussion of the student's personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required. :


The MotoGP championship is the premier class of motorcycle road racing and has been since the 1960s[^1]. It is comprised of ~17 race weekends, Friday-Sunday, at various, iconic circuits around the globe. Over the course of a single race weekend, riders and teams will participate in four to five practice sessions to tune their bikes and dial in a setting which will achieve the best result possible, i.e. win the race on Sunday.

[Die-hard fans and data nerds](http://reddit.com/r/motogp) monitor the results of these practice sessions to try and glean any insights they can as to what race results they might be in for. Patrons of the Motogp Discord server even have a fun prediction contest each weekend. After all of the practice sessions, users can submit their prediction for the race. The winner receives nothing but some ***totally real*** internet points and some notoriety on their profile.

I consider myself one of those invested fans and have been wanting to develope a play model to try and predict hte outcome of races. Over the last year or so, however, I notice some other areas of quandry with a weekends intermediate results that could possibly be answered, or light shed upon, with a datascience approach.

**Questions like:**
1. Does the weekends first practice session reuslt have more predictive power than the last, most recent, practice before the race?
2. Does the riders' proximity to the fastest time in any practice session mean more or less than the ordinal result?
3. **And ultimately, can we predict the outcome of the race, reasonably well?**

Have witnessed hundreds of races and their preliminary practice sessions, I believe that most of the signal required to predict a race outcome lies in the practice session result. 

## Problem Statement

* [ ] Student clearly describes the problem that is to be solved.
* [ ] The problem is well defined and has at least one relevant potential solution.
* [ ] Additionally, the problem is quantifiable, measurable, and replicable.
  
The act of predicting a race result given an input of practice results

## Datasets and Inputs

* [ ] The dataset(s) and/or input(s) to be used in the project are thoroughly described.
* [ ] Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included.
* [ ] It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

## Solution Statement

* [ ] Student clearly describes a solution to the problem.
* [ ] The solution is applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given.
* [ ] Additionally, the solution is quantifiable, measurable, and replicable.

## Benchmark Model

* [ ] A benchmark model is provided that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution.
* [ ] Ideally, the student's benchmark model provides context for existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which can then be objectively compared to the student's solution.
* [ ] The benchmark model is clearly defined and measurable.

## Evaluation Metrics

* [ ] Student proposes at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model presented.
* [ ] The evaluation metric(s) proposed are appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution.

## Project Design

* [ ] Student summarizes a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem.
* [ ] Discussion is made as to what strategies may be employed, what analysis of the data might be required, or which algorithms will be considered.
* [ ] The workflow and discussion provided align with the qualities of the project.
* [ ] Small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams are encouraged but not required.

## Presentation

* [ ] Proposal follows a well-organized structure and would be readily understood by its intended audience.
* [ ] Each section is written in a clear, concise and specific manner.
* [ ] Few grammatical and spelling mistakes are present. All resources used and referenced are properly cited.
